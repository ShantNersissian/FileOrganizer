<p align="center"><strong>Secure and Efficient File Transfer Application</strong>
<br/>

<h2>About</h2>
<strong>File Sharing is an application designed to transfer files securely and efficiently between devices on the same network. Built with privacy in mind, it employs end-to-end encryption to ensure that file contents remain confidential. This project was inspired by the need for a simple, secure, and direct file transfer method without relying on third-party cloud services.</strong><br/>

<h2>Goal and requirements</h2>
<strong>The primary goal of this project was to create a lightweight and platform-independent application that allows users to share files with ease, without the need for complex configurations. We aimed to provide a simple user interface that would enable even non-technical users to transfer files. The requirements were to ensure the application is secure, fast, and reliable. You can find more details in our <a href="DESIGN_DOC_LINK">design document</a>.</strong><br/>
 
<h3>Sprint Goal</h3>
<strong>For this sprint, the goal was to implement the core functionality of encrypted file transfer using a TCP connection, ensuring the application could handle various file types.</strong><br/>

<h2>Key learnings</h2>
<strong>Throughout the development process, we gained a deeper understanding of network programming, encryption algorithms, and file handling in Python. We also learned about the importance of user experience design in creating intuitive applications. We will revisit this section to elaborate on our learnings at the end of the sprint.</strong><br/>

<h2>Running your project</h2>
<strong>To run File Sharing, download the latest release for your operating system. Launch the application and follow the on-screen instructions to either send or receive files. Ensure both sender and receiver are on the same network and have the application open. When sending a file, select the file and enter the encryption key. The receiver will be prompted to enter the same encryption key to start the transfer. For detailed steps, refer to our <a href="README.md">README</a>.</strong><br/>
