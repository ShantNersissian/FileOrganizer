UI for Connecting to Peers: Your GUI currently lacks a way for users to specify the IP address and port of the peer they want to connect to. You might consider adding input fields to the GUI for this purpose.

Concurrency and Thread Safety: Since you're using threads (for the server), make sure that any code that updates the GUI (like setting the status text) is run in the main thread. Tkinter isn't thread-safe, so updating the GUI from a background thread can cause issues. Use master.after or a similar mechanism to schedule updates on the main thread.

Error Handling and Robustness: Consider adding more robust error handling around your socket operations. This includes handling exceptions that may occur during networking and ensuring sockets are properly closed even in case of errors.

Networking Details: The current networking setup is quite basic. In a real P2P environment, you'd have to handle more complex situations like peer discovery, handling multiple simultaneous connections, and potentially dealing with NAT traversal.

Security Considerations: Be aware of security implications, especially since file sharing can potentially expose your system to risks. Consider adding features like encryption for file transfers and validation to ensure the integrity and safety of shared files.

Testing: Thoroughly test your application in various scenarios to ensure it behaves as expected, handles errors gracefully, and provides a good user experience.
